# Exp-Data-Analysis-Project-1
Exploratory Data Analysis - course assignment - Project 1

Project 1 - Plot graphs using data files 

My code expects data file to be unzipped in current working directory with name "household_power_consumption.txt".
Final plots are saved in current working directory in format of .png 
- "plot1.R" creates "plot1.png" 
- "plot2.R" creates "plot2.png"
- "plot3.R" creates "plot3.png"
- "plot4.R" creates "plot4.png"




Data file structure:
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:
1.Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy 
2.Time: time in format hh:mm:ss 
3.Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) 
4.Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) 
5.Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) 
6.Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) 
7.Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). 
8.Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. 
9.Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
